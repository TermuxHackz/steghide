<li>Step1: Install the installation Commands first. (This is easy,  i wont elaborate on it) </li>
<li>Step2: Type <code>termux-setup-storage</code> in your termux terminal. </li>
<li>Step3: Get the apk you want to embed, then open your file manager (on ur phone), then cut/copy/move the apk into your "DCIM" folder or "downloads" folder üìÅ in your file manager. </li> 
<li>Step4: Look for an image you want to embed the apk into, then open your file manager and move/cut/copy the image into where you moved/cut/copied the apk eg if you moved the apk into your dcim folder,  then also move the inage into your dcim folder, and vice versa. </li>
<li>Step5: Remember the folder you stored both the apk and the image</li>
<li>Step6: Open your termux</li>
<li>Step7: Type <code>cd storage</code></li>
<li>Step8: Next Step is for you to go to the directory where kept both the apk and the image, eg if the apk and the image in your dcim folder, type <code>cd dcim</code> and if its in your download folder, type <code>cd downloads </code> </li>
<li>Step9: Make sure the apk and image you selected has a short name, if it doesn't, rename it</li>
<li>Step10: Type <code>cp nameofapk -r /$HOME/steghide</code> after that, lets copy the image to steghide folder by typing <code>cp nameofimage -r /$HOME/steghide</code> </li>
<li>Step11: Replace <b>nameofapk<b> with the actual name of the apk, and if the apk has two words in it like maybe fb lite.apk,  instead, type <code>cp 'fb lite.apk' -r /$HOME/steghide </code>, same thing goes for the image, but if the apk/the image doesnt have two words in it,  dont add the ''</li>
<li>Step12: Replace <b>nameofimage</b> witg the actual name of the image and also with the extension, either png, jpeg, etc. Example, if the image is named Screenshot-222222.png.
